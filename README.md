# ELMO Gold Motion Controllers EPICS driver.
An experimental attempt on developing an EPICS driver using asynMotorController driver model for the ELMO Gold series of motion controllers.

NOTE: Please note that this work hasn't been tested on actual controllers (yet), so any facility willing to use these controllers under EPICS are more than welcome to provide their contributions upon testing.
